Rent Near TU
Overview
Rent Near TU is a web application designed to revolutionize the process of finding dormitories near Thammasat University, Rangsit Campus. The platform tackles persistent challenges faced by students and tenants, such as incomplete or unreliable rental information and the time-intensive task of visiting properties in person. By providing a centralized, user-friendly online solution, Rent Near TU empowers tenants to search for fully furnished dorms, compare prices, and access comprehensive room details. Simultaneously, it enables landlords to list their properties efficiently, enhancing rental opportunities and fostering seamless communication between tenants and property owners.
The application prioritizes usability, accessibility, and efficiency. Tenants can filter dorms by price, proximity to the university, or specific amenities, while landlords benefit from an intuitive interface for managing listings. Built with modern design principles, the project incorporates user flows, wireframes, and high-fidelity designs created in Figma, ensuring a consistent and engaging experience across desktop and mobile devices. Rent Near TU aims to save time, reduce costs, and improve decision-making for its users, making it an essential tool for the Thammasat University community.
Motivation
The inspiration for Rent Near TU stems from the real-world struggles of students at Thammasat University, Rangsit Campus, who often face difficulties finding suitable accommodations. Traditional methods, such as word-of-mouth recommendations or physical visits to dorms, are inefficient and prone to misinformation. Many students spend hours traveling to view properties, only to find they don’t meet their needs or budget. Landlords, on the other hand, struggle to reach potential tenants effectively, relying on outdated advertising methods or third-party platforms with high fees. Rent Near TU addresses these pain points by creating a dedicated platform that streamlines the rental process, offering transparency, convenience, and reliability for both parties.
